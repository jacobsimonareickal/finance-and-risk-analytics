Business Case
In the recent past, the industry of wealth management has seen a lot of growth. Individuals and businesses actively seek maximum returns. However, in many cases, they lack either the skills to identify the right investment opportunities or the time to find such opportunities. This challenge gave rise to the dedicated individuals who perform this task on behalf of the investors for a commission: portfolio managers.

A portfolio manager makes investment decisions and carries out other related activities on behalf of vested investors. They work with a team of analysts and researchers, and their main objective is to realize the needs of the investor and suggest a suitable portfolio that meets all the expectations. They are responsible for establishing the best investment strategy and selecting appropriate investments with the right allocations. However, in doing so, they face a lot of competition in the form of other portfolio managers and rival firms. Therefore, the portfolio manager has to use the available resources to provide the best solution to the investor.

Consider yourself working for an associate at an investment firm that manages accounts for private clients. Your role requires you to analyze a portfolio of stocks to provide consultation on investment management based on client requirements.

Following points summarise the expected tasks to be performed for the capstone project:

You must use the elements of technical analysis to understand the trend of the underlying stocks. The metrics associated with risk and returns must help you realise whether the security meets the criteria of your investorâ€™s financial goals.
You must use the metrics and the visualisations to compare the performance of the available securities against each other, and also against the market index, S&P500.
The findings should be aligned with the investor persona to select the appropriate stocks for the portfolio.
After the selection of stocks, the portfolio must be validated using the active investment strategy to estimate the prices in future. You must check if the portfolio has the potential to fulfil the financial goals set by the investor.
The entire capstone can be divided into the following aspects:
